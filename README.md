# What is this?
This repository contains small presentations/workshops that I prepared on
different occasions.

# Contents

## Concepts
A workshop about programming with concepts in C++.
Associated slides [here](http://goo.gl/LTL6z).

## Rvalue references
A workshop about rvalue references in C++11.
Associated slides [here](http://goo.gl/SMOLu).

## Concept-based overloading (Opencode #9)
A presentation about using metafunctions to control overload resolution in C++.
The term _concept-based_ overloading is used because the metafunctions
considered in the presentation consider whether a type is a model of a
given concept.

The presentation assumes no previous exposure to the C++ language, although
it is strongly suggested.
