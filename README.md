## Concept-based overloading (Opencode #9)
A presentation prepared for the 9th edition of the
[Opencode](http://opencode.ca) in Qu√©bec. The presentation is about using
metafunctions to control overload resolution in C++. The term _concept-based_
overloading is used because the metafunctions considered in the presentation
determine whether a type is a model of a given concept.

The presentation assumes no previous exposure to the C++ language, although
it is strongly suggested.
